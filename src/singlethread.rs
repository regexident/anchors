//! Anchors' default execution engine.
//!
//! It's a single threaded engine capable of both Adapton-style pull updates
//! and â€” if `mark_observed` and `mark_unobserved` are used, Incremental-style push updates.
//!
//! As of September 2020, execution overhead per-node sits at around 100ns on this author's MacBook Air,
//! likely somewhat more if single node has a significant number of parents or children.
//! Hopefully this will significantly improve over the coming months.
